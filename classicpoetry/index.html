		<h2> SONNET 130 </h2>
		<p> My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun, </p>
		<p> Coral is far more red than her lips' red, </p>
		<p> If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun, </p>
		<p> If hair be wires, black wires grow on her head. </p>
		<p> I have seen roses damasked, red and white, </p>
		<p> But no such roses see I in her cheeks; </p>
		<p> And in some perfumes is there more delight </p>
		<p> Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. </p>
		<p> I love to hear her speak, yet well I know </p>
		<p> That music hath a far more pleasing sound; </p>
		<p> I grant I never saw a goddess go; </p>
		<p> My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. </p>
		<p> And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare </p>
		<p> As any she belied with false compare. </p>
