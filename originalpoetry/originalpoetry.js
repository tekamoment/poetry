This period of joy, however, is dampened by the sudden demise of the ship’s captain. The second stanza follows the structure set out by the previous stanza, building upon the celebration of the ship’s return and begins to talk about a crew member’s attempt to “rouse the captain from his sleep”.

The same purpose is also served by “ring of the bells” and “bugle trill”; perfect examples of onomatopoeia. These create imagery of the celebration on shore. Emphasis of the dead captain is conveyed through the repetition of the line “fallen cold and dead”. This line helps drive in the fact that no amount of rousing and glory will bring back the dead captain. It also shows the true face of war: not all success is sweet, and often comes at great cost. </p>";
