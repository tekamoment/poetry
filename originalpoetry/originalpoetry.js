The same purpose is also served by “ring of the bells” and “bugle trill”; perfect examples of onomatopoeia. These create imagery of the celebration on shore. Emphasis of the dead captain is conveyed through the repetition of the line “fallen cold and dead”. This line helps drive in the fact that no amount of rousing and glory will bring back the dead captain. It also shows the true face of war: not all success is sweet, and often comes at great cost. </p>";

	var paragraph4HTML = "<p>““Tree” is based around the author’s love and admiration for trees, and thanking God for their creation. The poem begins with the author’s acclamation that there “will never be a poem / as lovely as a tree”. Throughout the poem a tree is not referred to as an inanimsate object; rather, the tree is seen as a majestic creation only feasible through the power of God. This is seen through the author’s description of what makes a tree beautiful; its skyward stature, its connection to the bosom of the earth, its summer garb, its winter dress. The author contrasts each pair of ideas to convey the versatility of the tree in all situations: from the treetops pointing at the sky to the roots, hugging the earth, in the cold times of winter and in the heat of summer. The poem concludes with the author’s humble admission that “poems are created by fools like me / but only God can make a tree”. Through the very gracious language utilized by the author, it makes the poem feel like a prayer to God; to give thanks for the wonderful creation that is the tree. </p>";
