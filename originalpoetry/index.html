		<h1> Poetry? </h1>
		<p> A poem is alive </p>
		<p> Spurring from the inside </p>

		<p> A poem is a tear </p>
		<p> From someone's many fears </p>

		<p> A poem is a smile </p>
		<p> From moments all worthwhile </p>

		<p> A poem is a light </p>
		<p> Shining from day to night </p>

		<p> Poems will be forevermore </p>
		<p> From first light, 'til final war </p>
